A 'fork' is a message which is referencing another message,
but is significantly different to warrant having its own space.
A fork is used for starting a totally new thread, but marking the leaping off point which spawned it.

This is distinct from a 'nested-reply' in that a nested reply is a small aside,
but still well within the context of the original thread.
