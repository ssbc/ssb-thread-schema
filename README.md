# ssb-thread-schema

a module which provides you schemas and validators for messages invovled in threads.

## Example Usage

```js
var { isRoot, isReply } = require('ssb-thread-schema')

const testMsg = {
  type: 'post',
  text: 'oh choice, finally a less janky way to check our stuff',
  root: '%+fBXl12aV1wpAdD62RMl1WRhwthDMuAuHH4iNWgB7jA=.sha256',
  branch: [
    '%PK5aWmXVYJLcmRQTc/6EQE1ht9T5Kb+wi6NgTReMKXI=.sha256'
  ]
}
// can be the content of a message or the whole thing

isRoot(testMsg)
// => false
isRoot.errors
// => helpful errors

isReply(testMsg)
// => true
```

## API

### `isRoot(Object) -> Boolean`

`Object` can be a full message from the log, or just the content from the message, the validator will take care of it.

If the test Object fails the validation, errors are attached to the function (i.e. `isRoot.errors`, see [Example Usage](#example-usage))

An optional second argument can be passed to the validator if you want to tell the validator to attach errors to the test Object (this mutates the test Object):

```js
isRoot(Object, { attachErrors: true })
```

### `isReply(Object) -> Boolean`
same pattern ^


## TOTALLY UNSTABLE

These methods are based on experimental schema which need massive review and are going to be totally over-hauled.
Do not use them!

If you reeeeaaallly want to, require mehthods out from the files directly yourself.

### `isNestedReply(Object) -> Boolean`
same pattern ^

### `isFork(Object) -> Boolean`
same pattern ^

  - note it's turned out this 'spec' is way sloppy - has holes in it, and has been implemented differently in Patchwork
